# Fullstack Course 01: BTC Ticker Project
Welcome to the first project of the **Fullstack Course 2019**. This is one of the projects that we'll work on, and it will evolve along the way with new assignments building on top of what's done.

## Project description
BTC Ticker will be a web app that displays the current price of Bitcoin and other coins. The user will be able to add and remove coins from the dashboard. The dashboard should be responsive and allow as many coins to be added as possible.

## How will it work?
* This repository will contain the project in its entirety
* You will have to **fork** the project to your own Github
* Assignments will be posted as an **Issue** in this repository (look under the Issues tab)
* Regardless of project description you will only focus on what the **Issue** describes. This will be a customer need and you will need to solve it
* You will work on your own local copy of the code residing on your machine and commit it and push it your forked version of this repository
* When you feel you have completed the **Assignment/Issue** you will commit and push your code, and then from your repository on Github **Create a pull request** to this repository. Then I will review what's been done and approve it or request changes to be done before I can approve it
* Upon approval of a *Pull Request* I will post another **Issue** with new customer needs.
* Each **Issue** will come with a **deadline** for the work to be approved

## Technology stack
* React
* Latest Javascript
* Git
* Visual Studio Code
